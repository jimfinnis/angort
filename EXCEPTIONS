The exceptions are listed in exceptsymbs.h, and are symbols
prefixed with ex$. The exceptsymbs.h file is generated from
the excepts file (also in the include dir) by genexcepts, which
must be run manually. It's generally a good idea to try not to
add new exceptions.

Syntax:

    try
        ..
    catch:ex$except1
        ..
    catch:ex$except1,ex$except2..
        ..
    catchall
    endtry
    
Catches are tested in order, so

    try
        1 0 /
    catch:ex$divzero
        "Div zero".
    catchall
        "Something else".
    endtry
    
will work as expected.

Inside a catch, the exception and another value (typically
a detailed string, but if you throw your own exceptions it
can be anything) will be stacked. Often we drop them.

Here is a "safe" (rather silly) divide, which replaces division
by zero with a really big number

:safediv
    try
        /
    catch:ex$divzero
        drop drop 100000.0
    endtry;
    

Code generated:

The major thing here is the catchstack. This is a stack of
stacks of symbol->jumpoffset hashes. The outer stack is one-to-one
with the return stack (but can't be part of it for technical reasons,
see below). This outer stack is pushed and popped every time we go
into or out of a function. The inner stack is then the stack of
nested try-blocks, where the top one is the important one.

When we throw an exception, we keep popping off the inner stack,
then the outer stack, until we find a hash which contains that symbol.
As we pop the outer stack, we return (i.e. pop the rstack). Once we
have the symbol we jump to the offset in that frame.

This is big and inefficient.

(the reason referred to above is that Frames are only pushed when
we call - the top level is not kept in a frame structure, so we 
would have to copy the entire stack into the frame.)

OP_TRY (catchset: hash of symbols->integer offsets)
    pushes catchset onto runtime exception stack, which is
...
OP_JUMP endcatch
catch1:
...
OP_JUMP endcatch
catch2:
...
OP_JUMP endcatch
catch3:
...
OP_JUMP endcatch
endcatch:
OP_ENDTRY (pops exception)
...

OP_THROW (data symbol --)
    pops the exception symbol and data, and repeatedly returns
    until we have a frame with a catchset.



Compile time code:

The data structures here are:
    stack of catch lists (catchsets)
    catch is (list of symbols, start end).
    
try 
    push new catchlist onto compiletime catchset stack
    compile OP_TRY and push to cstack
catch:s1
    if first catch
        compile OP_JUMP and push to cstack
    else
        compile OP_JUMP, set curcatch->end to it
        (i.e. terminate previous catch)
    curcatch = new catch, appended to current catchlist
    curcatch->start = ip
    while there are symbols after the colon (comma separated),
        append to curcatch symbol list
catchall
    if first catch
        compile OP_JUMP and push to cstack
    else
        compile OP_JUMP, set curcatch->end to it
        (i.e. terminate previous catch)
    curcatch = new catch, appended to current catchlist
    curcatch->start = ip
    append a special key (id 0xdeadbeef) to the curcatch symbol list    


endtry
    if no catches throw error
    compile OP_JUMP, set curcatch->end to it
    (i.e. terminate previous catch)
    pop cstack and make OP_JUMP jump to IP
    resolve all OP_JUMPS (in "end" for all catches) to jump here
    make an exception hash (symbols->integer), and..
    for each catch in the catch list
     for each symbol in the catch
      exceptionhash[symbol]=catch start
    pop OP_TRY off the stack
    set the exception hash (d.catches) in OP_TRY to the exceptionhash.
    compile OP_ENDTRY
    pop the catch set off the catchset stack
