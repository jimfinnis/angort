There should be an Angort namespace.

Given that there are quite a few singletons (e.g type objects)
there's no real point in Angort not being a singleton.




Namespacing:
    listing
    need to find a way of quickly getting a func/prop name from ptr for showop
    what to do with "modules?" e.g. coll etc..
    at the moment, we set up separate namespaces. For now, I'm
    going to read everything into the default "std" space regardless.
