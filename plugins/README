I've deliberately kept the build structure very simple - there's just a
separate build script in each directory, which builds the library into the
libs directory. This is to make it simple for you to devise a build script for
your own plugin libraries.

The cmake install target for Angort copies any libraries in or below the libs
directory into the appropriate place (usr/local/share/angort, typically).

It is up to you to build which libraries you need. Typically the IO library
will be required. From this directory, 

cd io
./build

Then go back into the main Angort build directory and

sudo make install
