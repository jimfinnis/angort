To create an iterator for a GarbageCollected type, add to the type's
declaration:

    virtual Iterator<Value *> *makeIterator(Value *v);

Then, in the .cpp file for the type, declare a subclass of
Iterator<Value *> to do the iteration. The constructor for this
will typically take a pointer to the datum type (i.e. the
GarbageCollected subclass) of the iterable. It should store the datum,
increment its reference count, and initialise the iterator.
The destructor should decrement the reference count.

Then fill it the pure methods first(), next(), isDone() and current().


The iterator creation sequence goes like this:

    Type::createIterator(dest,src) is called
        makeIterator() is called in the type class, returning the iterator
        an iterator object is created, wrapped around this iterator.

THERE MAY BE MORE INVOLVED with iterating over GC types, and cycles and that.
