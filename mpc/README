A little example plugin and script, for a simple MPC client. Just
uses pipes to the standard mpc client.

Example usages:

    clr                     # wipe the current playlist

    "Cardiacs" artist add   # add all Cardiacs songs
    
    # as above, but use only those with "On Land" in the title
    # or album
    
    "Cardiacs" artist "On Land" grep add

    p                       # start playing

    # play the song "laburnum"
    
    "Laburnum" clr song add p

    # randomly play all Cardiacs songs
    
    clr "Cardiacs" artist add roff p
