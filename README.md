Angort is a stack-based language based on FORTH, with many extra features:

* local variables and function parameters
* lists and hashes (which are like Python dictionaries)
* garbage collection
* functions as first-class objects with functional programming constructs
* full lexical closure
* experimental threading support
* easy C++ interfacing
